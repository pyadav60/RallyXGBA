# RallyXGBA

...is a remake of the classic arcade racing game originally developed in Japan and Germany, RallyX, for the GBA.

## Drive to Survive
Your objective is to collect ten flags across 2 levels each. The flags will spawn in random locations across both maps each time, along with some boulders. Crashing into a boulder will cost you one of the three lives you start with. You are constantly burning fuel, and if you run out, its game over. There will also be 3 cars chasing you at all times, collisions also cost you a life. You can use a set amount of fuel to blast the enemy drivers with a cloud of fog, slowing them down. Be careful, as you can't spam this ability!

## Controls
- DPAD - movement
- START - play, pause, unpause
- SELECT - return to start from pause
- A - smokescreen
- B - skip to level 2 (for testing purposes)

## How to run
A Gameboy Advance, or GBA emulator is required to play this game.
I recommend mGBA as that's what we used in class.
I've only uploaded the final Project.gba ROM.
If you have the physical hardware to run it, you totally can!
This has been tested on a real working GBA, just plop the ROM file into a microSD / SD slot cartridge and voila!
